The growth in SSD capacity is reaching its limit 
due to the stunted growth of capacitors---electrical components that store charge 
to protect data for the volatile memory in case of power loss. 
\fi
This paper presents \ours{}, a novel SSD-internal DRAM management scheme 
that allows the SSD capacity to scale beyond the slow growth of capacitors. 
\ours{} judiciously manages the dirty memory footprint within the SSD-internal buffer 
by using a low-overhead data reordering scheme on
the deep queues available in today's storage interfaces.
In doing so, our design guarantees crash consistency 
while using a fraction of the capacitors compared to the state-of-the-art designs. 
We implement our design in FEMU %, an open-source SSD development framework,
and demonstrate that \ours{} delivers up to 1.4$\times$ higher IOPS and 49\% less write amplification 
compared to the existing scheme under power constraints. 
% and demonstrate that \ours{} delivers IOPS close to 90\% of the performance at only 1\% of capacitance compared to the existing scheme.
