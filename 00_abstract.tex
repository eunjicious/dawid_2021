\begin{abstract}
The growth in SSD capacity is reaching its limit 
due to the stunted growth of capacitors---electrical components that store charge 
to protect data for the volatile memory in case of power loss. 
This paper presents \ours{}, a novel SSD-internal DRAM management scheme 
that allows the SSD capacity to scale beyond the slow growth of capacitors. 
\ours{} suppresses an increase of the dirty memory footprint within buffer 
using the deep queues available in today's storage interfaces.
We implement our design in \texttt{FEMU}, an open-source SSD development framework
and demonstrate that \ours{} delivers IOPS close to 90\% of performance at only 1\% of capacitance compared to the existing scheme.
