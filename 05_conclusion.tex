\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present Hexa's design, implementation, 
and evaluation to reduce performance overhead due to metadata flush in 
a situation where PLP is partially supported on enterprise-class SSDs. 
Our desing operates using only a small amount of Capacitor's capacity compared
to the previous one. It also minimizes the impact of metadata by buffering requests using the 
scalability of the write buffer. 
Our evaluation results show that Hexa improves performance in situations where requests are randomly generated. 
In addition, JESD and real-benchmark results comfirm that there are advantages in a real-world environment.
