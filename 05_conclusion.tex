\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of JellyFish, 
a skip list that reduces the performance overheads for MVCC.
JellyFish separates per-key updates from the key indexing, 
allowing fast list traversals, efficient point queries, and fewer pointer changes for updates.
The benefits of our design are amplified as the memory size increases, 
and our evaluation results show that JellyFish not only improves the throughput,
but also the latency significantly.
