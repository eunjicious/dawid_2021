\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we raised an issue about capacitance constraints in scalable
SSDs and presented a novel SSD design called \ours{} to overcome the
limitation.  \ours{}-SSD protects a part of the buffer, but reduces the dirty
memory footprint by exploiting the increasing queue depth of the storage
interfaces. We implemented a \ours{}-SSD prototype in FEMU, an open-source SSD
development framework. Performance evaluation using the prototype shows that \ours{}-SSD 
delivers only XX\%-XX\% performance slowdown when capacitance is reduced to 1\%, 
while conventional SSD using FIFO decreases performance by XX\%.

Hexa's design, implementation, and evaluation to
reduce performance overhead due to metadata flush in a situation where PLP is
partially supported on enterprise-class SSDs.  Our desing operates using only a
small amount of Capacitor's capacity compared to the previous one. It also
minimizes the impact of metadata by buffering requests using the scalability of
the write buffer.  Our evaluation results show that Hexa improves performance
in situations where requests are randomly generated.  In addition, JESD and
real-benchmark results comfirm that there are advantages in a real-world
environment.
